Sentiment analysis in the social networks for the definition of innovation problems in organizations
Abstract
In recent years, on social networks, people can express their thoughts, write their emotions, and generate content about many topics. In order to discover the value of this information, in this article, we propose a sentiment analysis system for the social networks based on the “autonomic cycle of data analysis tasks” paradigm, to define innovation problems in an organization. This autonomic cycle has a set of tasks used for gathering and handling large unstructured data from social media, for the definition of innovation problems through sentiment analysis. The tasks of the autonomic cycle filter the negative tweets and determine their keywords. Then, they calculate the groups/clusters in the negative tweets, and for each cluster, they analyze each centroid to obtain additional information to answer the 5 questions of the W model (What, Where, When, Why, Who) that describe a problem. Particularly, considering this information on the clusters, the last task defines customer-oriented innovation problems. Finally, this article analyzes a case about tweets in a fashion enterprise, with results very encouraging.
